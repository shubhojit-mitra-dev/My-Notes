Control flow statements in JavaScript allow you to control the execution flow of your code, based on specific conditions or repeated tasks. They are crucial for making decisions, looping over collections, and managing program logic effectively.

### **1. If-Else Statements**

The `if` statement evaluates a condition, and if the condition is true, it runs a block of code. You can also use the `else` statement to run a different block of code if the condition is false.

**Syntax**

```javascript
if (condition) {
  // Block of code to execute if condition is true
} else {
  // Block of code to execute if condition is false
}
```

**Example**

```javascript
let age = 18; // Set the age

// Check if the person is an adult or a minor
if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are an adult.");  // If the age is 18 or greater, print "You are an adult."
} else {
  console.log("You are a minor.");  // If the age is less than 18, print "You are a minor."
}
```

**Explanation**:

- The condition `age >= 18` is checked.
- If true, the message "You are an adult." is logged.
- If false, the message "You are a minor." is logged.

**Best Practice**: Always use `else` as a fallback to cover all possible outcomes, and use clear and meaningful condition checks.

---
### **2. Else If Statement**

If you have multiple conditions to check, you can use `else if` after an initial `if` to check additional conditions.

**Syntax**

```javascript
if (condition1) {
  // Block of code if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // Block of code if condition2 is true
} else {
  // Block of code if neither condition is true
}
```

**Example**

```js
let temperature = 25; // Set the temperature value

// Check the weather condition
if (temperature > 30) {
  console.log("It's hot outside."); // If temperature > 30, print "It's hot outside."
} else if (temperature > 20) {
  console.log("The weather is warm."); // If temperature > 20 but <= 30, print "The weather is warm."
} else {
  console.log("It's cool outside."); // If temperature <= 20, print "It's cool outside."
}
```

**Explanation**:

- The `if` checks if the temperature is above 30.
- The `else if` checks if the temperature is greater than 20 but less than or equal to 30.
- The `else` catches the case when the temperature is 20 or below.

**Best Practice**: Always put the most general conditions at the end to avoid unnecessary evaluations, and try to minimize the number of `else if` statements.

### **3. Switch Statement**

The `switch` statement is a cleaner, more efficient way to check multiple possible conditions against a single variable. It is often used when you need to match an expression to a number of fixed values.

**Syntax**

```js
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // Code block if expression matches value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // Code block if expression matches value2
    break;
  default:
    // Code block if no match is found
}
```

**Example**

```js
let day = 3;  // Set the day number (1 = Monday, 2 = Tuesday, etc.)
let dayName;

// Use switch to get the name of the day
switch (day) {
  case 1:
    dayName = "Monday";
    break;
  case 2:
    dayName = "Tuesday";
    break;
  case 3:
    dayName = "Wednesday";
    break;
  case 4:
    dayName = "Thursday";
    break;
  case 5:
    dayName = "Friday";
    break;
  case 6:
    dayName = "Saturday";
    break;
  case 7:
    dayName = "Sunday";
    break;
  default:
    dayName = "Invalid day";  // If no match, print "Invalid day"
}

console.log(dayName);  // Output: "Wednesday"
```

**Explanation**:

- The `switch` statement compares the `day` variable with each `case` value.
- If a match is found, the corresponding block of code is executed, and the `break` statement exits the switch block.
- The `default` case provides a fallback if no cases match.

**Best Practice**: Always include a `default` case to handle unexpected values. Also, use `break` to avoid "fall-through" behavior where multiple cases execute unintentionally.

---
### **4. Ternary Operator**

The [[Operators#**7. Ternary Operator**|ternary operator]] is a concise way of writing `if-else` conditions in a single line.

**Syntax**

```js
condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;
```

**Example**

```js
let num = 10;  // Set a number
let result = (num % 2 === 0) ? "Even" : "Odd";  // Check if the number is even or odd

console.log(result);  // Output: "Even"
```

**Explanation**:

- The condition `(num % 2 === 0)` is checked.
- If true, `"Even"` is returned.
- If false, `"Odd"` is returned.

**Best Practice**: Use the ternary operator for simple conditional assignments, but avoid overly complex expressions that reduce readability.

---
### **5. For Loop**

A `for` loop is used to repeat a block of code a specific number of times, controlled by a counter.

**Syntax**

```js
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
  // Code block to be executed
}
```

**Example**

```js
// Loop through numbers 0 to 4
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);  // Output: 0 1 2 3 4
}
```

**Explanation**:

- `let i = 0`: Initialization sets the counter variable.
- `i < 5`: The loop runs while `i` is less than 5.
- `i++`: The counter is incremented after each iteration.

**Best Practice**: Keep loop conditions simple and make sure the loop has a clear exit condition to avoid infinite loops.

---

### **6. While Loop**

A `while` loop executes as long as the condition remains true. It’s often used when you don't know the number of iterations in advance.

**Syntax**

```js
while (condition) {
  // Code block to be executed
}
```

**Example**

```js
let i = 0;  // Initialize the counter

// Loop while i is less than 5
while (i < 5) {
  console.log(i);  // Output: 0 1 2 3 4
  i++;  // Increment i
}
```

**Explanation**:

- The condition `i < 5` is checked before each iteration.
- The code inside the `while` loop runs as long as the condition is true.

**Best Practice**: Make sure the condition eventually becomes false to avoid infinite loops.

---

### **7. Do-While Loop**

A `do-while` loop is similar to a `while` loop, but it ensures that the block of code runs at least once, even if the condition is false.

**Syntax**

```js
do {
  // Code block to be executed
} while (condition);
```

**Example**

```js
let i = 0;  // Initialize the counter

// The code will run at least once
do {
  console.log(i);  // Output: 0 1 2 3 4
  i++;  // Increment i
} while (i < 5);
```

**Explanation**:

- The code inside the `do` block runs first, and then the condition `i < 5` is checked.

**Best Practice**: Use `do-while` when you need to execute a block of code at least once, even if the condition is initially false.

---

### **8. Break Statement**

The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or a `switch` statement early.

**Example**

```js
// Loop through numbers 0 to 4
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  if (i === 3) {
    break;  // Exit the loop when i equals 3
  }
  console.log(i);  // Output: 0 1 2
}
```

**Explanation**:

- The loop runs until `i === 3`. When that happens, the `break` statement stops the loop immediately.

**Best Practice**: Use `break` when you need to exit a loop based on a condition, especially when you have an early exit strategy.

---

### **9. Continue Statement**

The `continue` statement skips the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration.

**Example**

```js
// Loop through numbers 0 to 4
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  if (i === 3) {
    continue;  // Skip the iteration when i equals 3
  }
  console.log(i);  // Output: 0 1 2 4
}
```

**Explanation**:

- When `i === 3`, the `continue` statement skips the current iteration and goes back to the next iteration.

**Best Practice**: Use `continue` to skip specific conditions within loops without terminating the entire loop.

---

### **10. Return Statement**

The `return` statement is used in functions to exit the function and optionally return a value.

**Example**

```js
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;  // Return the sum of a and b
}

console.log(sum(5, 10));  // Output: 15
```

**Explanation**:

- The `return` statement exits the function `sum` and sends the result back to the caller.

**Best Practice**: Always use `return` to exit functions, and try to keep functions focused on a single task for readability and maintainability.

---
### **11. Short-Circuiting in JavaScript**

JavaScript short-circuits [[Operators#**4. Logical Operators**|logical expressions]] to optimize performance.

- **For `&&` (AND)**: If the first operand is `false`, it **stops execution** and returns the first value.
- **For `||` (OR)**: If the first operand is `true`, it **stops execution** and returns the first value.

**Example**

```js
let username = "John";

console.log(username && "Welcome, " + username);  // "Welcome, John"

console.log("" && "Welcome, User");  // ""

console.log(username || "Guest");  // "John"

console.log("" || "Guest");  // "Guest"
```

**Explanation**

- `username && "Welcome, John"` → Since `username` is `"John"`, it evaluates the second value.
- `"" && "Welcome, User"` → `""` is a falsy value, so it returns `""`.
- `username || "Guest"` → Since `username` is `true`, it returns `"John"`.
- `"" || "Guest"` → `""` is falsy, so it returns `"Guest"`.

**Best Practice**: Use short-circuiting for default values (`||`) and conditional rendering (`&&`).

### **Interview Questions**

1. **What is the difference between `if` and `switch`?**
    
    - `if` handles complex conditions, while `switch` is more efficient when checking a single variable against many possible fixed values.
    
2. **What is the purpose of `break` and `continue` statements?**
    
    - `break` exits a loop or switch statement prematurely, and `continue` skips the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration.
    
3. **What’s the difference between a `while` loop and a `do-while` loop?**
    
    - A `while` loop checks the condition before the loop starts, while a `do-while` loop ensures that the code runs at least once, checking the condition after the code block.
    
4. **How would you handle an infinite loop in JavaScript?**
    
    - Ensure the loop has a proper exit condition or add a `break` statement to terminate it if necessary.
